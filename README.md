# WeatherStar 4000+

A live version of this project is available at https://weatherstar.netbymatt.com

## About

This project aims to bring back the feel of the 90s with a weather forecast that has the look and feel of The Weather Channel at that time but available in a modern way. This is by no means intended to be a perfect emulation of the WeatherStar 4000, the hardware that produced those wonderful blue and orange graphics you saw during the local forecast on The Weather Channel. If you would like a much more accurate project please see the [WS4000 Simulator](http://www.taiganet.com/). Instead, this project intends to create a simple to use interface with minimal configuration fuss. Some changes have been made to the screens available because either more or less forecast information is available today than was in the 90s. Most of these changes are captured in sections below.

## What's your motivation

Nostalgia. And I enjoy following the weather, especially severe storms.

It's also a creative outlet for me and keeps my programming skills honed for when I need them for my day job. 

### Included technology
I've kept this open source, well commented, and made it as library-free as possible to help others interested in programming be able to jump right in and start working with the code.

From a learning standpoint, this codebase make use of a lot of different methods and technologies common on the internet including:

* The https://api.weather.gov REST API. ([documentation](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)).
* ES 6 functionality
	* Arrow functions
	* Promises
	* Async/await and parallel loading of all forecast resources
	* Classes and extensions
	* Javascript modules
* Separation between API code and user interface code
* Use of a modern date parsing library [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/)
* Practical API rates and static asset caching
* Very straight-forward hand written HTML
* Build system integration (Gulp, Webpack) to reduce the number of scripts that need to be loaded
* Hand written CSS made easier to mange with SASS
* A linting library to keep code style consistent

## Does WeatherStar 4000+ work outside of the USA?

This project is tightly coupled to [NOAA's Weather API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api), which is exclusive to the United States. Using NOAA's Weather API is a crucial requirement to provide an authentic WeatherStar 4000+ experience.

If you would like to display weather information for international locations (outside of the USA), please checkout a fork of this project created by [@mwood77](https://github.com/mwood77):
- [`ws4kp-international`](https://github.com/mwood77/ws4kp-international)

## Run Your WeatherStar
To run via Node locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/netbymatt/ws4kp.git
cd ws4kp
npm i
node index.mjs
```

To run via Docker: 
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/netbymatt/ws4kp
```
Open your web browser: http://localhost:8080/ 

To run via Docker Compose (docker-compose.yaml):
```
---
services:
  ws4kp:
    image: ghcr.io/netbymatt/ws4kp
    container_name: ws4kp
    environment: 
      # Each argument in the permalink URL can become an environment variable on the Docker host by adding WSQS_
      # Following the "Sharing a Permalink" example below, here are a few environment variables defined. Visit that section for a
      # more complete list of configuration options.
      - WSQS_latLonQuery="Orlando International Airport Orlando FL USA"
      - WSQS_hazards_checkbox=false
      - WSQS_current_weather_checkbox=true
    ports:
      - 8080:8080 # change the first 8080 to meet your local network needs
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Serving static files
The app can be served as a static set of files on any web server. Run the provided gulp task to create a set of static distribution files:
```
npm run build
```
The resulting files will be in the /dist folder in the root of the project. These can then be uploaded to a web server for hosting, no server-side scripting is required.

When using the provided Docker image, the browser will generate `playlist.json`
on the fly by scanning the `/music` directory served by nginx. The image
intentionally omits this file so the page falls back to scanning the directory.
Simply bind mount your music folder and the playlist will be created
automatically. If no files are found in `/music`, the built in tracks located in
`/music/default/` will be used instead.

The nginx configuration also sets the `X-Weatherstar: true` header on all
responses. This uses `add_header ... always` so the header is sent even for
404 responses. When `playlist.json` returns a 404 with this header present, the
browser falls back to scanning the `/music` directory. If you host the static
files elsewhere, be sure to include this header so the playlist can be generated
automatically.

## What's different

I've made several changes to this Weather Star 4000 simulation compared to the original hardware unit and the code that this was forked from.

* Radar displays the timestamp of the image.
* A new hour-by-hour graph of the temperature, cloud cover and precipitation chances for the next 24 hours.
* A new hourly forecast display for the next 24 hours is available, and is shown in the style of the travel cities forecast. (off by default because it duplicates the hourly graph)
* The SPC Outlook is shown in the style of the old air quality screen. This shows the probability of severe weather over the next 3 days at your location.
* The "Local Forecast" and "Extended Forecast" provide several additional days of information compared to the original format in the 90s.
* The original music has been replaced. More info in [Music](#music).
* Marine forecast (tides) is not available as it is not reliably part of the new API.
* "Flavors" are not present in this simulation. Flavors refer to the order of the weather information that was shown on the original units. Instead, the order of the displays has been fixed and a checkboxes can be used to turn on and off individual displays. The travel forecast has been defaulted to off so only local information shows for new users.

## Sharing a permalink (bookmarking)
Selected displays, the forecast city and widescreen setting are sticky from one session to the next. However if you would like to share your exact configuration or bookmark it, click the "Copy Permalink" (or get "Get Permalink") near the bottom of the page. A URL will be copied to your clipboard with all of you selected displays and location (or copy it from the page if your browser doesn't support clipboard transfers directly). You can then share this link or add it to your bookmarks.

Your permalink will be very long. Here is an example for the Orlando International Airport:
```
https://weatherstar.netbymatt.com/?hazards-checkbox=false&current-weather-checkbox=true&latest-observations-checkbox=true&hourly-checkbox=false&hourly-graph-checkbox=true&travel-checkbox=false&regional-forecast-checkbox=true&local-forecast-checkbox=true&extended-forecast-checkbox=true&almanac-checkbox=false&spc-outlook-checkbox=true&radar-checkbox=true&settings-wide-checkbox=false&settings-kiosk-checkbox=false&settings-scanLines-checkbox=false&settings-speed-select=1.00&settings-units-select=us&latLonQuery=Orlando+International+Airport%2C+Orlando%2C+FL%2C+USA&latLon=%7B%22lat%22%3A28.431%2C%22lon%22%3A-81.3076%7D
```
You can also build your own permalink. Any omitted settings will be filled with defaults. Here are a few examples:
```
https://weatherstar.netbymatt.com/?latLonQuery=Orlando+International+Airport
https://weatherstar.netbymatt.com/?kiosk=true
https://weatherstar.netbymatt.com/?settings-units-select=metric
```

### Kiosk mode
Kiosk mode can be activated by a checkbox on the page. Note that there is no way out of kiosk mode (except refresh or closing the browser), and the play/pause and other controls will not be available. This is deliberate as a browser's kiosk mode it intended not to be exited or significantly modified. A separate full-screen icon is available in the tool bar to go full-screen on a laptop or mobile browser.

It's also possible to enter kiosk mode using a permalink. First generate a [Permalink](#sharing-a-permalink-bookmarking), then to the end of it add `&kiosk=true`. Opening this link will load all of the selected displays included in the Permalink, enter kiosk mode immediately upon loading and start playing the forecast.

### Default query string parameters (environment variables)
When serving this via the built-in Express server, it's possible to define environment variables that direct the user to a default set of parameters (like the  [Permalink](#sharing-a-permalink-bookmarking) above). If a user requests the root page at `http://localhost:8080/` the query string provided by environment variables will be appended to the url thus providing a default configuration.

Environment variables can be added to the command line as usual, or via a .env file which is parsed with [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv). Both methods have the same effect.

Environment variables that are to be added to the default query string are prefixed with `WSQS_` and then use the same key/value pairs generated by the [Permalink](#sharing-a-permalink-bookmarking) above, with the `- (dash)` character replaced by an `_ (underscore)`. For example, if you wanted to turn the travel forecast on, you would find `travel-checkbox=true` in the permalink, its matching environment variable becomes `WSQS_travel_checkbox=true`.

When using the Docker container, these environment variables are read on container start-up to generate the static redirect HTML.

## Music
The WeatherStar had wonderful background music from the smooth jazz and new age genres by artists of the time. Lists of the music that played are available by searching online, but it's all copyrighted music and would be difficult to provide as part of this repository.

I've used AI tools to create WeatherStar-inspired music tracks that are unencumbered by copyright and are included in this repo. To keep the size down, I've only included 4 tracks. Additional tracks are in a companion repository [ws4kp-music](https://github.com/netbymatt/ws4kp-music).

If you're looking for the original music that played during forecasts [TWCClassics](https://twcclassics.com/audio/) has thorough documentation of playlists.

### Customizing the music
Placing .mp3 files in the `/server/music` folder will override the default music included in the repo. Subdirectories will not be scanned. When weatherstar loads in the browser it will load a list if available files and randomize the order when it starts playing. On each loop through the available tracks the order will again be shuffled. If you're using the static files method to host your WeatherStar music is located in `/music`.

If using Docker, you can bind mount a local folder containing your music files.
Mount the folder at `/usr/share/nginx/html/music` so the browser can read the
directory listing and build the playlist automatically. If there are no `.mp3`
files in `/music`, the built in tracks from `/music/default/` are used.
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/local/music:/usr/share/nginx/html/music ghcr.io/netbymatt/ws4kp
```

### Music doesn't auto play
Ws4kp is muted by default, but if it was unmuted on the last visit it is coded to try and auto play music on subsequent visits. But, it's considered bad form to have a web site play music automatically on load, and I fully agree with this. [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/#media_engagement_index) and [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/firefox-66-to-block-automatically-playing-audible-video-and-audio/) have extensive details on how and when auto play is allowed.

Chrome seems to be more lenient on auto play and will eventually let a site auto-play music if you're visited it enough recently and manually clicked to start playing music on each visit. It also has a flag you can add to the command line when launching Chrome: `chrome.exe --autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required`. This is the best solution when using Kiosk-style setup.

If you're unable to pre-set the play state before entering kiosk mode (such as with a home dashboard implementation) you can add the query string value below to the url. The browser will still follow the auto play rules outlined above.
```
?settings-mediaPlaying-boolean=true
```

## Community Notes

Thanks to the WeatherStar community for providing these discussions to further extend your retro forecasts!

## Customization
A hook is provided as `/server/scripts/custom.js` to allow customizations to your own fork of this project, without accidentally pushing your customizations back upstream to the git repository. A sample file is provided at `/server/scripts/custom.sample.js` and should be renamed to `custom.js` activate it.

When using Docker, mount your `custom.js` file to `/usr/share/nginx/html/scripts/custom.js` to customize the static build.

## Issue reporting and feature requests

Please do not report issues with api.weather.gov being down. It's a new service and not considered fully operational yet. I've also observed that the API can go down on a regional basis (based on NWS office locations). This means that you may have problems getting data for, say, Chicago right now, but Dallas and others are working just fine.

Before reporting an issue or requesting a feature please consider that this is not intended to be a perfect recreation of the WeatherStar 4000, it's a best effort that fits within what's available from the API and within a web browser.

Note: not all units are converted to metric, if selected. Some text-based products such as warnings are simple text strings provided from the national weather service and thus have baked-in units such as "gusts up to 60 mph." These values will not be converted.
